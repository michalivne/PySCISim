This file holds recommendations for make SCISim more user-friendly
as a blackbox simulator to be used with external projects.

- Separate GUI from simulator.
- Easier scene loading.
- Easeir save/load of simulation state (serialization).
- Unified interface (sim + sim state) to get all required attributes.
- Allow to read/write angle-axis/quaternions rather then rotation matrix.
